# Switching-Power-Supply-Board

This is a switching power supply board with six layers that I made during a course of PCB design.

This board was made as part of a course by Fedevel Academy, this course was a great introduction to Altium and PCB design.

The output directory contains a PDF with the 3D view of the board and the schematics.
